# Foundations

This folder contains base skills and setup guidance you should complete before diving into individual AWS service deep dives:

- Linux, Git, and networking refreshers
- AWS account setup and security guardrails
- AWS CLI installation and configuration
- Tips for staying within the Free Tier

The main repository `README.md` provides a high-level overview. Detailed step-by-step guides will be added here as we extract the foundational material from the original roadmap.
