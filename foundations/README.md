# Foundations

Build confidence with the prerequisites every AWS DevOps engineer needs before tackling individual services. Each subfolder below contains hands-on drills, checklists, and curated resources.

## Modules

| 📂 Folder | What You’ll Cover |
| --- | --- |
| [`linux-cli/`](./linux-cli/) | Terminal navigation, file management, remote access, and scripting warm-ups |
| [`git-and-github/`](./git-and-github/) | Daily Git habits, branching strategies, and GitHub collaboration workflows |
| [`networking-basics/`](./networking-basics/) | CIDR math, routing, security controls, and DNS essentials |
| [`aws-account-setup/`](./aws-account-setup/) | Account creation, guardrails, budgets, and governance best practices |
| [`tooling/`](./tooling/) | Workstation setup for AWS CLI, Terraform, SAM, Docker, Node.js, and Python |

## Quickstart Checklist

- ✅ Review the Linux and Git refreshers; complete the practice labs
- 🔐 Harden your AWS account with MFA, IAM roles, billing alarms, and budgets
- 🧰 Install and validate CLI + automation tooling using the provided scripts
- 🌐 Revisit networking concepts to design VPCs confidently in later modules

## How This Fits the Roadmap

Complete everything in the `foundations/` area before starting the `services/` deep dives. You’ll reuse the created AWS sandbox account and local tooling for every lab, so investing time here saves rework later. Come back whenever you need a refresher or want to onboard a teammate to the same baseline.
