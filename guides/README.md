# Guides & Reference Material

Supporting content that supplements the main learning path:

- **tools-comparison.md** – CloudFormation vs Terraform vs CDK, CI/CD tooling, container orchestration options
- **resources.md** – Curated list of books, courses, YouTube channels, and communities
- **interview-prep.md** – Question banks, scenarios, and hands-on assessments

Each guide will be extracted from the original monolithic README and expanded over time.
