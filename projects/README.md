# Hands-On Projects

Practical labs to reinforce what you learn in each service deep dive. Every project folder will contain:

- A detailed walkthrough (`README.md`)
- Infrastructure as Code (CloudFormation/Terraform) or scripts as needed
- Optional architecture diagrams or reference assets

| # | Project | Folder |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | Jenkins on EC2 with Auto Scaling | [project-01-jenkins](./project-01-jenkins/) |
| 02 | Secure 3-Tier VPC Architecture | [project-02-secure-vpc](./project-02-secure-vpc/) |
| 03 | S3 Static Website with CloudFront CDN | [project-03-s3-static-site](./project-03-s3-static-site/) |
| 04 | Infrastructure as Code with CloudFormation | [project-04-cloudformation](./project-04-cloudformation/) |
| 05 | Multi-Environment Deployment with Terraform | [project-05-terraform](./project-05-terraform/) |
| 06 | AWS Native CI/CD Pipeline | [project-06-aws-cicd](./project-06-aws-cicd/) |
| 07 | Serverless API (Lambda + API Gateway) | [project-07-serverless-api](./project-07-serverless-api/) |
| 08 | Containerized App on ECS Fargate | [project-08-ecs-fargate](./project-08-ecs-fargate/) |
| 09 | Kubernetes Workload on EKS | [project-09-eks](./project-09-eks/) |
| 10 | Production Database with RDS Multi-AZ | [project-10-rds](./project-10-rds/) |

Each folder now includes architecture blueprints, implementation steps, validation checklists, and stretch goals to push your learning. Follow the projects sequentially or cherry-pick the ones that match your role requirements.

Start with project 01 as soon as you finish the EC2 and VPC deep dives to cement the core infrastructure concepts.
